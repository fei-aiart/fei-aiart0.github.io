## Biography

**Fei Gao** is currently with the [Media Intelligence Lab (MIL)](http://mil.hdu.edu.cn/) and the Key Laboratory of Complex Systems Modeling and Simulation, [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://computer.hdu.edu.cn/), in [Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU)](http://www.hdu.edu.cn/). He received his Bachelor Degree in Electronic Engineering and Ph.D. Degree in Information and Communication Engineering from [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/) (Xi'an, China) in 2009 and 2015, respectively. His Ph.D. advisor is Prof. [Xinbo Gao](http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/). From Oct. 2012 to Sep. 2013, he was a Visiting Ph.D. Candidate in Prof. [Dacheng Tao](http://www.uts.edu.au/staff/dacheng.tao/)'s Group, in University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) in Australia. 



He mainly applies machine learning techniques to computer vision problems. His research interests include **image quality assessment and enhancement, biomedical image processing, generative models, deep learning,** etc. His research results have expounded in 20 publications at prestigious journals and conferences, such as IEEE T-NNLS, Pattern Recognition, Neurocomputing, and Signal Processing. He serverd for a number of journals and conferences, including IEEE Trans. on Image Processing (TIP), IEEE Trans. on Cybernetics (TC), IEEE Trans. on Multimedia (TMM), IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), Information Sciences, Signal Processing, Neurocomputing, and CVPR, etc.
